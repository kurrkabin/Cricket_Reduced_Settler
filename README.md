Built an automation tool that validates how each cricket market should be settled when a match is shortened before it starts (due to rain, weather, or scheduling).
The app mirrors DraftKings’ official house rules and helps traders make consistent settlement calls without manually scanning PDFs or spreadsheets.

Key points:

Encodes 50+ settlement scenarios for ODI & T20 formats (e.g., Top Batter, Total Sixes, Fall of 1st Wicket).

Converts natural-language house rules into executable logic via AI-assisted rule translation.

Delivers instant “STANDS/VOID/DEPENDS” outputs per market, minimizing error rates and improving handover speed.

Used internally to standardize decision logic across traders and shifts.

Includes a built-in usage tracker for lightweight analytics and audit trail.

Impact:
Reduced settlement ambiguity, improved consistency between traders, and demonstrated how rule interpretation can be automated using lightweight Python + Streamlit frameworks.
