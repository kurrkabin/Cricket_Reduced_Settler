# 🏏 Cricket Reduced Matches Tool

**Cricket Reduced Matches Tool** is a specialized rules engine built in Python to dynamically evaluate betting market validity for cricket matches affected by overs reductions. This project adheres strictly to the official DraftKings (DK) Cricket House Rules and supports formats including **Test**, **ODI**, and **T20**.
